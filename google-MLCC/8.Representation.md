### Repesentation

 - Extracting features from raw data and determine vectors
 - one-hot vector
 - avoid non zeros
 - features shouldn't change over times
 - create boolean bins to classify non linear models
 - Visualize / Debug / Monitor

 ### Feature Engineering

  - Feature vector is floating point values from data
  - Feature engineering it converting raw data to a vector
  - Example JSON to a flat array

 ### Models need to be numeric

  - Map strings to numbers
  - one hot encoding [0,1,0]
  - use dictionaries to map enumerated values
  - [1,2,3] === [Neatherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg]
  - booleans could work too for extensible features

  ### Qualities of good features

  - avoid rarely used discrete feature values 5 or more times
  - use meaningful values
  - don't mix magic with real values
  - is_defined instead of -1
  - definition of feature shouldn't change over time
