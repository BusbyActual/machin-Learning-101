### Repesentation

 - Extracting features from raw data and determine vectors
 - one-hot vector
 - avoid non zeros
 - features shouldn't change over times
 - create boolean bins to classify non linear models
 - Visualize / Debug / Monitor

 ### Feature Engineering

  - Feature vector is floating point values from data
  - Feature engineering it converting raw data to a vector
  - Example JSON to a flat array

 ### Models need to be numeric

  - Map strings to numbers
  - one hot encoding [0,1,0]
