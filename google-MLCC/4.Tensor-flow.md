### Getting started with Tensor Flow
  - used for ML models
  - general graph based computational framework. Low level skils
  - has high level frameworks as well
  - we'll be using the estimator

### Excercises

  - start using highest level API with most abstraction.
  - less flexible by design

 ## Part One - Panda

  - for setup import pandas as pd
  - panda has two primary classes for data structs

  - Dataframe is kinda like an Object
  - Series is basically an Array ~ Neat^tm

  - if you map vars to dataframe length needs to match bor els eit gets mad

  - most of the time you just do
```
  _dataframe_ = pd.read_csv()
  _dataframe_,describe()
```
  ### Data Access

  - has funcs like ".head()" && ".hist()" for grabing first rows and showing a series respectively

 - basically js
 ```
  print type(obj[key])
 ```

  - slice is baked in
 ```
  cities[0:2]
 ```

  ### Maniputating Data

  - arithmatic operators are same as js but you can do to a series automagically

  - did someone say import numpy as np

  - python wants lamda callbacks?

  ```
  Series.apply(labda thing: thing > 100000 )
  ```

  - python lets you just divide arrays touch` meng.  obj[key] = obj[key] / obj[key]


  ### Problem 1
   - modify cities table and add a column that's true if area > 50 and cityName.contains('San')
   ```
   cities['Memes'] = (cities['Area square miles'] > 50) & (cities['City name'].apply(lambda val: val[0:3] == 'San'))
 cities['Memes']
   ```


   - you can change indexes of a table with `table.reindex[val1,val2,val3,..]` or `table.reindex(np.random.permutation(table.index))`

   ### Problem 2

   - i guess for data input you can reindex without values of an index for space?

   - A missing indexes easier for reindex and no need to sanitize input?


   ### First steps with Tensor Flow

    - randomize data to not get pathological ordering effects that will harm stochastic descent

    - define features, target, and config linear regressor Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
    - specify data types as categorical or numerical
