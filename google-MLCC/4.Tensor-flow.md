### Getting started with Tensor Flow
  - used for ML models
  - general graph based computational framework. Low level skils
  - has high level frameworks as well
  - we'll be using the estimator

### Excercises

  - start using highest level API with most abstraction.
  - less flexible by design

 ## Part One - Panda

  - for setup import pandas as pd
  - panda has two primary classes for data structs

  - Dataframe is kinda like an Object
  - Series is basically an Array ~ Neat^tm

  - if you map vars to dataframe length needs to match bor els eit gets mad

  - most of the time you just do
```
  _dataframe_ = pd.read_csv()
  _dataframe_,describe()
```

  - has funcs like ".head()" && ".hist()" for grabing first rows and showing a series respectively

 - basically js
 ```
  print type(obj[key])
 ```
