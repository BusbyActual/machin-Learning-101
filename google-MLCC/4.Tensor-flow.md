### Getting started with Tensor Flow
  - used for ML models
  - general graph based computational framework. Low level skils
  - has high level frameworks as well
  - we'll be using the estimator

### Excercises

  - start using highest level API with most abstraction.
  - less flexible by design

 ## Part One - Panda

  - for setup import pandas as pd

  - panda has two primary classes for data structs
