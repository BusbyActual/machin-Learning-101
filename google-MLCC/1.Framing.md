### Supervised machine learning
  -  Label is a true thing we're predicting
  -  Feature's are inputs or config for ML system
  -  Model maps examples to predicted labels


### Models
  - To train is to learn the model. This is examples provided to have the ML learn the dataset.
  - Inference is to apply the model to unlabeled examples


### Regression vs. classification
  - Regression is for continuous values
  - I.e. values / probablities

### Classification
  - email spam?
  - dog or cat?
